            postText="The Battle of Centauri was an armed military engagement between 
            the Tevarin and the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and was the final battle
             of the Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610). On 24 June 2610, 
             the Tevarin Warlord Corath'thal and his forces entered the Centauri
              system with the Centauri-Elysium jump point as their goal, around which the UEE Navy 
              (UEEN) had placed a blockade. Instead of charging for the jump point, 
              Corath'thal's fleet diverted for Yar and Saisei, forcing the 
              UEEN to break its formation and defend the populace leaving a small 
              contingent of ships behind to protect the jump point."
